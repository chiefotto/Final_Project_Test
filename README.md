# Final_Project_Test


API: https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba

Website Name: StatPaddr

The target browser would be a laptop/desktop screen. Our project uses a JS library called Chart.js. This library allowed us to create bar charts of the data pulled from the API.
Our project attempts to visualize live NBA data since live statistics are often mundane to read since it often appears as a complicated statsheet.
