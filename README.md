About:
  Our project intends to solve the display of raw statistics from live data. On most sites, live NBA data are just numbers,
  with STATPADDR you have visualizations to understand what they mean better. We also are capable of live comparison. Where a user 
  can compare players who are playing at that moment, giving them a head-to-head comparison.
